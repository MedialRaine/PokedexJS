## Description
### In this project is a very basic of a web app. We have focused on the CSS for giving the appereance of a real pokédex, and JS for the get request and fetching the data that the pokéAPI gives for getting the info of each pokemon, like the attacks, stats, photo, etc. We have seen the promises and async programming concepts.
